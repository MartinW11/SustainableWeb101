    <h2>How does proffesional companies apply sustainability?</h2>
    <p> Upon a visit to Amsterdam with my university I talked to some businesses that make graphic design, websites and ect. Here we talked a lot about how to make your website as sustainable as possible without compromising with what your customer wants or needs. A lot of the companies I talked to found it both hard, important and exciting, to find approaches that make it more possible to be sustainable as a web developer, designer and so on. Many of the rules I have listed here on my page for sustainable design were initiatives that these big companies already used to make the websites more sustainable. However, often the graphic design were valued higher than sustainability, because it sometimes was hard to compromise with layout or colors, that the page needs for it to e.g. sell products and the customers to be happy.
        <br>
        Therefor it's in my opinion that you as a designer or developer take into consideration to take as many green initiatives as possible behind the scenes when making a website, because often the customers doesn't know or care about it.
        <br>

        In 2025 a new EU legislation will move into force with the new WGAG guidelines. This means that from 2025 all websites have to have at least an AA in the accessibility guidelines. With climate change and so-on itâ€™s almost certain that more guidelines will move into power in the future.  Which means that you as a web designer or developer might benefit from already knowing how to make your websites highly sustainable as companies might look to someone who can make this for them.
