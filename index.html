        <div class="modal-body">
            Choose colors with a low carbon footprint: Some colors require more energy to display than others. For
            example, black requires less energy than white, so using a black background can help reduce energy
            consumption. Additionally, using darker colors can also help reduce energy consumption because they require
            less light to be displayed.
            <br>
            So how much does each RGB color use in full brightness?
            <br>
            Red: 600mW.
            <br>
            Green: 580mW.
            <br>
            Blue: 800mW.

            To shrink picture files for a sustainable website, you can:
            <br>
            Compress your images using online tools like TinyPNG or software programs like Adobe Photoshop.

            Reduce image dimensions before uploading them to your website.
            Optimize image quality to balance image quality with file size.
            Use responsive images to adjust image size and resolution based on the user's device and screen size.

        <div class="modal-body">
            To shrink video files for a sustainable website, you can:
            <br>
            Compress your video files using tools like Handbrake or Adobe Media Encoder.
            Choose efficient video formats like MP4 or WebM instead of older formats like AVI or MOV.
            Reduce the video resolution without compromising on quality.
            Shorten video length and break up longer videos into smaller clips.
            Host videos on third-party platforms like YouTube or Vimeo to reduce website storage space.

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            To use fonts for a sustainable website, you can:
            <br>
            Limit the number of font styles and use them consistently.
            Choose web-safe fonts to reduce the need for additional font files.
            Use font subsets to reduce the size of font files.

            Good SEO practices can have several environmental benefits. By optimizing website loading times, reducing
            the size of media files, and using sustainable web hosting, you can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse
            gas emissions. Additionally, these practices can extend the lifespan of electronic devices, minimize
            electronic waste, and demonstrate your commitment to sustainability, which can help build a positive brand
            image.

            <div class="title">#6 Lazy Loading</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            Lazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of non-critical resources on a web page, such as images,
            until they are needed. This can help to improve website performance and reduce the amount of data that needs
            to be downloaded, which in turn can have several environmental benefits, including:
            <br>
            Reduced data usage: By delaying the loading of non-critical resources, lazy loading can reduce the amount of
            data that needs to be downloaded, which can help to reduce the amount of energy used by servers and devices
            during the data transfer process.
            <br>
            Improved website speed: By prioritizing the loading of critical resources, lazy loading can help to improve
            website speed and reduce page load times, which can lead to a better user experience and increased
            engagement.

    <button class="button7 bubble_hover" data-modal-target="#modal7">#7 AMP</button>
    <div class="modal" id="modal7">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div class="title">#7 AMP</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            AMP can benefit a sustainable website in several ways. It can reduce energy consumption and improve website
            speed, leading to a better user experience and increased engagement. Additionally, AMP pages are prioritized
            by search engines, which can increase your website's reach and promote sustainable practices.

    <button class="button8 bubble_hover" data-modal-target="#modal8">#8 Declutter Site</button>
    <div class="modal" id="modal8">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div class="title">#8 Declutter Site</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            Decluttering your website can improve sustainability by reducing energy consumption and improving the user
            experience. A cluttered website can slow down page loading times, leading to increased energy consumption,
            while a simplified design can promote engagement and align with your brand values. Additionally, a
            decluttered website can be easier to maintain and update over time, reducing costs and energy usage.

    <button class="button9 bubble_hover" data-modal-target="#modal9">#9 Hosting</button>
    <div class="modal" id="modal9">

            <div class="title">#9 Hosting</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            Choosing a sustainable website host is important for reducing the environmental impact of your website. Opt
            for a host that uses energy-efficient servers, powered by renewable energy sources, offers carbon offsetting
            programs, and allows you to monitor and optimize your resource usage. By doing so, you can minimize energy
            consumption, lower carbon emissions, and promote a more sustainable future.

    <button class="button10 bubble_hover" data-modal-target="#modal10">#10 Dark Mode</button>
    <div class="modal" id="modal10">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div class="title">#10 Dark Mode</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            Dark mode on a website is a good feature for sustainability because it reduces energy consumption of devices
            with OLED and AMOLED screens by displaying black backgrounds instead of white. This results in lower energy
            consumption and potentially longer battery life for devices, leading to a reduction in overall energy
            consumption and carbon emissions.
